Counting Sheep
What is the input to the program? 3 (a number)
What is the output of the program?  The input number recursively subtracted counting down sheep until zero with text output for each call.
What is the input to each recursive call? The previous input number minus one

Power Calculator
What is the input to the program? X and Y (2 integers greater than 0)
What is the output of the program? The exponent that results in X^Y
What is the input to each recursive call? X and (Y minus 1)
What is the output of each recursive call? X times the call to power calculator, with X and Y minus 1 as parameters
Reverse String
What is the input to the program? The string
What is the output of the program? The string in reverse
What is the input to each recursive call? The call to the function, with the first letter removed from the original string.
What is the output of each recursive call? Once the base case of 1 letter remaining is hit, that 1 letter is returned and added to an array.

Nth Triangular Number
What is the input to the program? N
What is the output of the program? The count of the nth triangle (number of dots)
What is the input to each recursive call? N minus 1
What is the output of each recursive call?  Returns n plus the call to the function, with n-1 as the parameter

What is the input to the program? The string
What is the output of the program? The seperated string in bracketed parts
What is the input to each recursive call? The string after the first detected seperator, minus that seperator
What is the output of each recursive call? The first piece of the string before the seperator added to an array as itâ€™s own string


Fibonacci

What is the output of the program? The Fibonacci result
What is the input to each recursive call? N minus 1
What is the output of each recursive call? N times call to function, with n plus 1 as parameter


Factorial
What is the input to the program? n
What is the output of the program? The factorial result
What is the input to each recursive call? N minus 1
What is the output of each recursive call? N times call to function, with n - 1 as parameter


Find a way out of the maze
